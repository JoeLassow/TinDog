TinDog website using Bootstrap plus other CSS and HTML

I have been devoloping my HTML and CSS since i uplaoded my last project. As you can see it looks a lot more professional now using many CSS techniques such as flexbox and grid plus so0me cool animation.

I have used the external framework BootStrap as well in this project.

Soon i will learn about JavaScript and encoperate that into my projects to.
